    "1. *Breaks* the complex problem into sub problems\n",
    "2. Finds the *optimal* solution for that subproblems\n",
    "3. Saves the result this is called **memoization**\n",
    "4. If same sub problem repeats then the saved result will be used rather than solving the sub problem repeatedly\n",
